Moneta
======

Moneta is a web application emulating different kinds of package repositories.
The goal is not to replace official mirrors like packages.debian.org or mirror.centos.org, but to have a single location
for all your Python/Java/Debian/RedHat private packages.

Repositories are created on-the-fly and you can limit upload rights to some groups of users.

Currently, you can create the following types of repositories:

    * Aptitude for Ubuntu or Debian systems,
    * Yum for CentOS, Fedora or Red Hat systems,
    * Maven for Java or Scala packages,
    * Pypi for Python packages,
    * any binary, versionned files.

You can read more docs at http://moneta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html .


In the future, I would like to add the following kinds of repositories:

    * Jetbrains for IntelliJ/PyCharm/PhpStor/Clion plugins,
    * brew (packaging system for OS X),
    * CPAN for Perl,
    * LaTeX,
    * Gem for Ruby,
    * PHP,
    * JS.
