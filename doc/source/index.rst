Welcome to Moneta's documentation!
==================================

Moneta is a web application emulating different kinds of package repositories.
The goal is not to replace official mirrors like packages.debian.org or mirror.centos.org, but to have a single location
for all your Python/Java/Debian/RedHat private packages.
