Welcome to Updoc's documentation!
=================================

UpDoc is a web application for uploading developer documentations, with a few interesting tips.


Main features:

    * drag and drop archives of documentations (.zip or .tar.gz with a bunch of HTML files) to upload them,
    * RSS feed with the last uploaded docs,
    * RSS feed with the docs that you frequently check,
    * upload archives with a single cURL request,
    * generate RSS feeds with your bookmarks,
    * generate a proxy.PAC file.

RSS feeds can be added as bookmarks folders in Firefox, so it is very easy to share sets of bookmarks in a company.
Archives are fully indexed, so you can search any text inside all documentations, or inside a specific one.
